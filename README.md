# Age Verification System in Flutter

This documentation guides you through the implementation of the Opale.io age verification solution in a Flutter application. The system utilizes an `InAppWebView` to display a web-based verification process, allowing for a seamless and integrated user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK
- An IDE (VSCode, Android Studio, etc.)
- `flutter_inappwebview` package

Add the dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_inappwebview: ^6.0.0
```
